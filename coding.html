            <h1>Definition</h1>
            <p1>Coding is the process of writing rules that computers can subsequently understand
                and carry out. Although many individuals would argue that there is a tiny difference
                between coding and programming, the two terms ultimately still relate to the same
                fundamental process.</p1>
            <h2>Is it important?</h2>
            <blockquote>Languages spoken by humans are not understood by computers.
                As a result, learning a coding language, or better yet, a programming language,
                is necessary for you to be able to speak with computers.<br>
                Binary is the fundamental sort of code that computers can comprehend.
                Only 0s and 1s are used in binary, with 0 denoting off and 1 denoting on.
                Because they are created by joining thousands of transistors, which are solid
                state off and on switches, these 0s and 1s are understood by computers.<br>
                In binary, the 0s instruct transistors to turn off, and the 1s instruct transistors to
                turn on. You can connect with computers and instruct them to perform a task when
                thousands of these transistors cooperate through the use of binary.<br>
                The drawback of binary is that it would take forever to manually turn on and off a
                computer's thousands of transistors. To help programmers with these duties,
                new low-level and high-level programming languages were developed.<br>
